Welcome to my first Odin project!
This will be a simple webpage with 3 of my favorite recipes on it.
I have always had a passion for learning how to code.
I started when I was 18 years old and still in highschool but never really took it seriously.
I'm excited to see what big things can come from The Odin Project!
