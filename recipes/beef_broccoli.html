            <li><strong>1/2 Cups</strong> - Water</li>

            <li><strong>1/4 Tsp</strong> - Crushed Red Pepper Flakes, <em>or more, to taste</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Prep everything ahead of time as the actual cooking part goes very quickly. 
                To prep the steak, trim off any fat and slice it across the grain into very 
                thin bite-size pieces. Add the sauce ingredients to a bowl and whisk together thoroughly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to a large skillet over high heat. 
                Let the pan heat up for a few minutes (oil should be shimmering).
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the broccoli and cook for 4-5 minutes, tossing/stirring often 
                (it'll be tender-crisp). Transfer it to a plate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the skillet. 
                Add the beef in a single layer (just sort of "sprinkle" it into the pan ensuring 
                it's spread out a bit) and don't touch it for a minute. Stir/flip it with cooking 
                tongs and cook it for another minute or so. It cooks fast and will easily overcook 
                and become tough. Leaving it a bit rare at this stage is ideal.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the broccoli back to the pan and pour the sauce in. 
                Stir/toss until coated and the sauce has thickened (about 1-3 minutes). 
                Take the skillet off the heat and serve immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
