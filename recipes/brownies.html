        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish 
                <strong>(not a 9x9 dish or your brownies will overcook) </strong> 
                with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, 
                powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok) 
                and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, 
                or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached 
                <em>(note: it's better to pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long).</em> 
                Cool completely before slicing.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Notes</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                If you'd like to reduce the sugar, I've had success 
                with 1 cup granulated sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups.
            </li>
            <li>
                I like to use olive oil because it's what I keep on hand and 
                I enjoy the pairing of olive oil with chocolate. 
                Keep in mind that you will taste it here. 
                For a more neutral flavor, use canola oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                When these brownies come out of the oven, they'll be super gooey in the middle. 
                Allow them to cool completely, about 2 hours, before you slice into 
                them to give them a chance to set up. They'll continue to firm 
                up the longer they're out of the oven.
            </li>
        </ul>
